# Network implementation progress

Overnight, unattended implementation of the Promptboard Network feature (owner request, 2026-10-26).

- **Branch:** `feat/network`, worktree `.claude/worktrees/network`, cut from `origin/main` 67aff01. Never pushed, merged or force-pushed by this run.
- **Specification:** `docs/network/NETWORK_REQUIREMENTS.md` (copy of the owner's file). Task files: `/Users/kingogboss/Downloads/Promptboard_Network_Claude_Tasks/tasks/NN-*.md` (identical to the sections of `/Users/kingogboss/Downloads/Promptboard_Network_Implementation_Plan.md`).
- **Order:** strictly 01 → 14. A task starts only after the previous one is implemented, tested and committed.
- **Run rules:** one implementation agent per task; the coordinator reviews the diff, reruns the task's tests and the full suite, and checks every acceptance criterion with evidence before the next task. Isolated app instances only (ports 4900+, temporary data folders, a PATH holding only node plus fake CLIs unless a bounded live smoke test is explicitly logged here). Never touch the owner's app (port 4318, `~/Library/Application Support/Promptboard`, `~/Promptboard/projects`, `~/Desktop/promptboard-github`).
- **Live provider runs:** bounded opt-in smoke tests only, cheapest models, each one logged below with provider and result.

### Task 01 — Audit current code and freeze integration contracts (2026-10-26)

**What was done.** Read the requirements, the task files 01–14, README, SECURITY.md, the listed docs and the code paths
the later tasks touch (`server.mjs`, `store.mjs`, `durable.mjs`, `board.mjs` run/backup paths, `supervisor.mjs`,
`agents.mjs`, `providers.mjs`, `research-cli.mjs`, `base*.mjs`, `session-activity.mjs`, `usage.mjs`, `lessons.mjs`,
`coordinator.mjs`, `remote-access.mjs`, `schedules.mjs`, `public/app.js` routing, `public/index.html`,
`tests/remote-access.test.mjs`). Checked npm for the candidate dependencies and inspected their published tarballs in a
throw-away folder (removed afterwards; nothing installed). Wrote the two contract documents. No runtime source, test or
existing file format was changed.

**Files.** `docs/network/architecture.md` (new), `docs/network/acceptance.md` (new), this file.

**Key decisions** (details and `file:line` evidence in architecture.md):

- Storage: every Network entity in its own versioned file under `<dataDir>/network/` through `src/durable.mjs`
  (atomic write + `.bak`, set-aside of damaged files, newer version refused, `serial()` + CAS). Nothing in
  `state.json` (stays version 14) and nothing in board backups (stay version 12); a separate Network export/import.
- Execution: Network jobs do not use Board/Supervisor (that would need a spoofed card, run record and worktree) and do
  not take the shared one-job CLI slot. They run on the existing headless adapters (`streamResearch` for Claude/Codex,
  `runProvider` for tool-less Gemini; Antigravity refused) in an empty per-attempt folder, read-only, optional web
  search only, with their own pool (default 2, 1–4). Two small shared changes later: optional usage parsing in
  `research-cli.mjs` and an optional `layers` argument for `resolveBase`; sign-in waits for Network jobs.
- Completion only from a structured final result plus exit 0; anything else is failed/unknown; a crash after launch is
  `interrupted`/uncertain and is never retried without the owner.
- Routes: owner `/api/network/*` behind the unchanged `handle()` checks; paired devices allowed except credential,
  listener and federation-trust routes (local-only); external clients only on a separate, off-by-default loopback
  listener with scoped bearer tokens (SHA-256 at rest); MCP as a stdio bridge to that listener; A2A inbound/outbound
  separately switched, with an SSRF-guarded `fetchImpl`.
- Event stream as NDJSON over fetch (token stays in a header), not `EventSource`.
- Dependencies: `cytoscape` 3.34.3 (MIT) served from `/vendor/`, with a CSP-safe stylesheet placeholder;
  `cytoscape-edgehandles` rejected (needs a global lodash, unmaintained since 2021); `@modelcontextprotocol/server`
  2.3.1 (matches the installed client/core 2.3.1); `@a2a-js/sdk` 1.3.0 (A2A protocol 1.0, no Express needed). Each is
  at least two weeks old; the newer `cytoscape` 3.34.4 and MCP 2.4.0 are too new.
- 14 requirement/HEAD conflicts listed with the chosen option (architecture.md §14).

**Existing Network implementation:** none (no `src/network/`, no `/api/network`, `#/network`, A2A or Cytoscape code);
`origin/main` is still `67aff01`, no remote branch named for Network.

**Baseline tests** (worktree HEAD `ade0233`, code identical to `origin/main` `67aff01`; log
`$TMPDIR/network-logs/task-01-baseline.log`, 2026-10-26 03:00–03:27, about 27 minutes):

- `npm run check`: pass ("All JavaScript files pass the syntax check.").
- `npm test` non-browser phase: 1,506 tests, 1,505 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled, 1 skipped.
- `npm test` browser phase (headless Chrome): 146 tests, 146 pass, 0 fail, 0 skipped.
- Total: 1,652 tests, 1,651 pass, 0 fail, 1 skipped. Exit code 0. No reruns were needed.
- The one skip is `tests/editors.test.mjs` "Windows: program folders, a JetBrains IDE … never a .cmd", which runs only
  on `win32`. Other `skip: process.platform === 'win32'` tests ran on this Mac. Chrome was available, so no browser test
  skipped. `npm test` contains no live-provider test: live checks are separate scripts (`scripts/live-*.mjs`,
  `npm run eval:live`) and were not run (zero paid CLI runs in this task).

**Acceptance criteria and evidence:**

- *Architecture identifies concrete existing integration points and files with evidence from HEAD:* architecture.md §2
  (table of 30 integration points with `file:line`), §7.1 (traced Kanban run path), §8 (capability matrix from
  `agents.mjs`/`providers.mjs`/`research-cli.mjs`), §12 (routing lines in `app.js`/`index.html`). Line numbers were
  re-checked against the files after writing.
- *Dependency/task map lists prerequisites and non-goals; no running systems or existing formats are modified:*
  architecture.md §15 (map, per-task prerequisites and non-goals, never-in-scope list), §4.4 and §11.4 (formats
  unchanged); `git show --stat 27646ef` touches only `docs/network/`; the owner's app on port 4318 was not touched.
- *Baseline tests recorded honestly, including failures and skipped live tests:* this section (counts above, the skip
  named, no live tests in the suite).
- *Explicit design for uncertain outcomes, authority, revocation, timeouts, migration and privacy:* architecture.md
  §6.1–6.3 (state machines with uncertain/interrupted handling), §11.1 authority, §11.2 revocation, §11.3 timeouts and
  uncertain outcomes, §11.4 migration, §11.5 privacy, SSRF and prompt injection; acceptance.md §6 failure and recovery
  matrix (37 rows).

**Known issues / open questions** (architecture.md §16): Base "Used by" does not list Network registrations; default
job concurrency 2 and timeout 20 minutes are guesses; workspace-write and repository-reading jobs are post-MVP;
whether the board backup should later embed the Network export; headless usage field names must be confirmed in the
Task 07 opt-in smoke.

**Next task: 02.**

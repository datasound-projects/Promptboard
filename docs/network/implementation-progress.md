# Network implementation progress

Overnight, unattended implementation of the Promptboard Network feature (owner request, 2026-10-26).

- **Branch:** `feat/network`, worktree `.claude/worktrees/network`, cut from `origin/main` 67aff01. Never pushed, merged or force-pushed by this run.
- **Specification:** `docs/network/NETWORK_REQUIREMENTS.md` (copy of the owner's file). Task files: `/Users/kingogboss/Downloads/Promptboard_Network_Claude_Tasks/tasks/NN-*.md` (identical to the sections of `/Users/kingogboss/Downloads/Promptboard_Network_Implementation_Plan.md`).
- **Order:** strictly 01 → 14. A task starts only after the previous one is implemented, tested and committed.
- **Run rules:** one implementation agent per task; the coordinator reviews the diff, reruns the task's tests and the full suite, and checks every acceptance criterion with evidence before the next task. Isolated app instances only (ports 4900+, temporary data folders, a PATH holding only node plus fake CLIs unless a bounded live smoke test is explicitly logged here). Never touch the owner's app (port 4318, `~/Library/Application Support/Promptboard`, `~/Promptboard/projects`, `~/Desktop/promptboard-github`).
- **Live provider runs:** bounded opt-in smoke tests only, cheapest models, each one logged below with provider and result.

## Rules every task agent follows

1. Read `docs/network/NETWORK_REQUIREMENTS.md`, the task file, `docs/network/architecture.md`, `docs/network/acceptance.md` and this file before coding. The architecture decisions (storage under `<data>/network/`, headless read-only job workers, owner routes under `/api/network/*`, separate machine listener, NDJSON streams, §14 conflict choices) are binding unless a task proves one wrong; then document the change in architecture.md.
2. Commit locally only (message "Network: …" with the Co-Authored-By trailer), explicit paths, never push/merge/rebase/stash/force; CHANGELOG.md only in Task 14.
3. Match the codebase: dense ESM, plain DOM JS, no TypeScript/build step/framework; reuse durable.mjs, Base resolver, providers/research-cli, server.mjs handle(), remote-access localOnly, dom.js and app api(). New code in `src/network/` and `public/network*.js`; minimal wiring in shared files. New npm dependencies only as exact pinned versions at least two weeks old, license and advisories checked.
4. Security and data: every route behind handle(); computer-only routes in localOnly; no secrets anywhere persistent or returned; untrusted input stays data; fail closed; saving/editing/importing never executes; old data folders load unchanged; nothing deleted automatically.
5. Isolated app instances only (port 49NN for task NN, temporary data folders, PATH with only a node symlink plus fakes). Never touch the owner's app on 4318 or its folders. Headless Chrome via tests/helpers/browser.mjs only.
6. Paid CLI runs only within the budget a task prompt gives, cheapest models, each logged under "Live provider runs".
7. Tests: `tests/network-*.test.mjs` (browser: `*-browser.test.mjs`), every behaviour with a failing-without test, cross-platform rules (path.join, CRLF, no fixed ports, no real CLIs/network/Docker, injectable clocks, no `main` assumption, no exact page width). Run `npm run check`, new tests twice, touched modules' tests, then the full `npm test` (log in `$TMPDIR/network-logs/task-NN-suite.log`).
8. Update this file (row + "Task NN" section) and commit it with the task's last commit.

## Task log

(Each task adds a section: changes, files, tests and results, acceptance evidence, known issues, commit.)

### Task 01 — Audit current code and freeze integration contracts (2026-10-26)

**What was done.** Read the requirements, the task files 01–14, README, SECURITY.md, the listed docs and the code paths
the later tasks touch (`server.mjs`, `store.mjs`, `durable.mjs`, `board.mjs` run/backup paths, `supervisor.mjs`,
`agents.mjs`, `providers.mjs`, `research-cli.mjs`, `base*.mjs`, `session-activity.mjs`, `usage.mjs`, `lessons.mjs`,
`coordinator.mjs`, `remote-access.mjs`, `schedules.mjs`, `public/app.js` routing, `public/index.html`,
`tests/remote-access.test.mjs`). Checked npm for the candidate dependencies and inspected their published tarballs in a
throw-away folder (removed afterwards; nothing installed). Wrote the two contract documents. No runtime source, test or
existing file format was changed.

**Files.** `docs/network/architecture.md` (new), `docs/network/acceptance.md` (new), this file.

**Key decisions** (details and `file:line` evidence in architecture.md):

- Storage: every Network entity in its own versioned file under `<dataDir>/network/` through `src/durable.mjs`
  (atomic write + `.bak`, set-aside of damaged files, newer version refused, `serial()` + CAS). Nothing in
  `state.json` (stays version 14) and nothing in board backups (stay version 12); a separate Network export/import.
- Execution: Network jobs do not use Board/Supervisor (that would need a spoofed card, run record and worktree) and do
  not take the shared one-job CLI slot. They run on the existing headless adapters (`streamResearch` for Claude/Codex,
  `runProvider` for tool-less Gemini; Antigravity refused) in an empty per-attempt folder, read-only, optional web
  search only, with their own pool (default 2, 1–4). Two small shared changes later: optional usage parsing in
  `research-cli.mjs` and an optional `layers` argument for `resolveBase`; sign-in waits for Network jobs.
- Completion only from a structured final result plus exit 0; anything else is failed/unknown; a crash after launch is
  `interrupted`/uncertain and is never retried without the owner.
- Routes: owner `/api/network/*` behind the unchanged `handle()` checks; paired devices allowed except credential,
  listener and federation-trust routes (local-only); external clients only on a separate, off-by-default loopback
  listener with scoped bearer tokens (SHA-256 at rest); MCP as a stdio bridge to that listener; A2A inbound/outbound
  separately switched, with an SSRF-guarded `fetchImpl`.
- Event stream as NDJSON over fetch (token stays in a header), not `EventSource`.
- Dependencies: `cytoscape` 3.34.3 (MIT) served from `/vendor/`, with a CSP-safe stylesheet placeholder;
  `cytoscape-edgehandles` rejected (needs a global lodash, unmaintained since 2021); `@modelcontextprotocol/server`
  2.3.1 (matches the installed client/core 2.3.1); `@a2a-js/sdk` 1.3.0 (A2A protocol 1.0, no Express needed). Each is
  at least two weeks old; the newer `cytoscape` 3.34.4 and MCP 2.4.0 are too new.
- 14 requirement/HEAD conflicts listed with the chosen option (architecture.md §14).

**Existing Network implementation:** none (no `src/network/`, no `/api/network`, `#/network`, A2A or Cytoscape code);
`origin/main` is still `67aff01`, no remote branch named for Network.

**Baseline tests** (worktree HEAD `ade0233`, code identical to `origin/main` `67aff01`; log
`$TMPDIR/network-logs/task-01-baseline.log`, 2026-10-26 03:00–03:27, about 27 minutes):

- `npm run check`: pass ("All JavaScript files pass the syntax check.").
- `npm test` non-browser phase: 1,506 tests, 1,505 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled, 1 skipped.
- `npm test` browser phase (headless Chrome): 146 tests, 146 pass, 0 fail, 0 skipped.
- Total: 1,652 tests, 1,651 pass, 0 fail, 1 skipped. Exit code 0. No reruns were needed.
- The one skip is `tests/editors.test.mjs` "Windows: program folders, a JetBrains IDE … never a .cmd", which runs only
  on `win32`. Other `skip: process.platform === 'win32'` tests ran on this Mac. Chrome was available, so no browser test
  skipped. `npm test` contains no live-provider test: live checks are separate scripts (`scripts/live-*.mjs`,
  `npm run eval:live`) and were not run (zero paid CLI runs in this task).

**Acceptance criteria and evidence:**

- *Architecture identifies concrete existing integration points and files with evidence from HEAD:* architecture.md §2
  (table of 30 integration points with `file:line`), §7.1 (traced Kanban run path), §8 (capability matrix from
  `agents.mjs`/`providers.mjs`/`research-cli.mjs`), §12 (routing lines in `app.js`/`index.html`). Line numbers were
  re-checked against the files after writing.
- *Dependency/task map lists prerequisites and non-goals; no running systems or existing formats are modified:*
  architecture.md §15 (map, per-task prerequisites and non-goals, never-in-scope list), §4.4 and §11.4 (formats
  unchanged); `git show --stat 27646ef` touches only `docs/network/`; the owner's app on port 4318 was not touched.
- *Baseline tests recorded honestly, including failures and skipped live tests:* this section (counts above, the skip
  named, no live tests in the suite).
- *Explicit design for uncertain outcomes, authority, revocation, timeouts, migration and privacy:* architecture.md
  §6.1–6.3 (state machines with uncertain/interrupted handling), §11.1 authority, §11.2 revocation, §11.3 timeouts and
  uncertain outcomes, §11.4 migration, §11.5 privacy, SSRF and prompt injection; acceptance.md §6 failure and recovery
  matrix (37 rows).

**Known issues / open questions** (architecture.md §16): Base "Used by" does not list Network registrations; default
job concurrency 2 and timeout 20 minutes are guesses; workspace-write and repository-reading jobs are post-MVP;
whether the board backup should later embed the Network export; headless usage field names must be confirmed in the
Task 07 opt-in smoke.

**Next task: 02.**

### Task 02 — Durable agent and network registry (2026-10-26)

**What was done.** Agent registrations that reference Base `profile`/`agentProfile` resources by ID only, networks
(agent and sub-network nodes with positions, `message`/`delegate`/`share_result` relations) as a draft plus immutable
published versions, owner routes under `/api/network/*`, and a Network-only export/import. Base is read through
`board.base.list()` only; `state.json`, Base and the board backup format are untouched. No UI, no jobs, nothing that
starts a process.

**Files.** New: `src/network/storage.mjs` (NetworkError, IDs, versioned/immutable file discipline over
`durable.mjs`), `src/network/registry.mjs` (model validation, registry, cycle check, export/import),
`src/network/http.mjs` (routes), `tests/network-registry.test.mjs`, `tests/network-http.test.mjs`. Changed:
`src/server.mjs` (registry created in `startServer` with the server's data folder and Board's Base and project list;
route branch after the Coordinator; `NetworkError` in `EXPOSED`), `tests/remote-access.test.mjs` (every Task 02 route
in `ALLOWED`, `network/http.mjs` scanned), `docs/network/architecture.md` (§4.6 decisions), this file.

**Data layout** (created on the first save; reading creates nothing): `<data>/network/agents.json`
(`promptboard.network-agents` v1, `{ revision, rows }` + `.bak`), `network/networks/<escapeId(id)>.json`
(`promptboard.network-draft` v1 + `.bak`), `network/networks/<escapeId(id)>/v<n>-<sha256>.json`
(`promptboard.network-version` v1, written once, hash of the exact bytes checked on every read, never deleted).

**Routes** (all behind `handle()`; all allowed from a paired device per §10.2, none local-only, so `localOnly()` is
unchanged): `GET/POST /api/network/agents`, `GET/PATCH /api/network/agents/:id`, `GET/POST /api/network/networks`,
`GET/PATCH /api/network/networks/:id`, `POST /api/network/networks/:id/publish`,
`GET /api/network/networks/:id/versions/:n`, `GET /api/network/export`, `POST /api/network/import`. Lists take
`offset`/`limit` (1–200, default 50) and filters (`q`, `tag`, `capability`, `status`, `baseResourceId`, `projectId`,
`networkId` for agents; `q`, `agentId` for networks) and answer `{ total, offset, limit, next, … }`.

**Decisions** (architecture.md §4.6): body limits per route (a draft may be 8 MiB, so the 1 MiB default of §4.2 rule 8
does not apply to network and import bodies); disabled/untrusted Base agents can be registered and show as stale;
`POST /networks` takes no revision (no collection file); cycles are checked by network ID through pinned published
versions; a stored file that is not exactly what the registry writes counts as damaged; export refuses while a draft
is unreadable; import writes registrations, then versions, then drafts.

**Tests** (all with temporary data folders, no CLI, no network):

- `tests/network-registry.test.mjs` 13 tests: reference-only registration with `state.json` and Base revision
  unchanged; Base edit shown, `agents.json` unchanged; missing/wrong-kind refused, disabled/untrusted/deleted stale
  and kept; concurrent row and collection CAS; draft → v1 → edit → v2 with v1 bytes unchanged; cycles self, A→B→A,
  A→B→C→A and through an old pinned version; strict content; restart; damaged `agents.json` with good and bad
  backup, newer version; unreadable and hand-edited drafts; tampered version hash; export/import identical, remapped,
  and refused whole (unknown or non-agent Base ID, tampered hash, missing reference, cycle, newer file, extra field,
  wrong kind of file); filters, paging, no folder on read.
- `tests/network-http.test.mjs` 3 tests: missing token, wrong Host, foreign Origin, cross-site, proxy header all 403;
  413, 415, 400, 404; a full owner flow over HTTP, then a new `startServer` on the same folder showing the same IDs,
  revisions, scopes, drafts and versions; every file outside `network/` (state.json, its backup, Base revisions,
  Origin project), the board backup, Base and Origin byte-identical before/after; a `child_process` recorder (proven
  to see processes started inside `src/`) records zero processes; a paired device calls every Task 02 route.
- `tests/remote-access.test.mjs`: route table now includes all 12 Task 02 rows and scans `network/http.mjs`; removing
  a row makes it fail (checked).
- Mutation check: patching out the cycle check, row CAS, disabled-on-import, agent remap, unresolved-Base refusal,
  set-aside, damaged refusal, newer refusal, hash check, kind check or the version file name each makes a test fail.
- Runs: `npm run check` pass; new tests twice 16/16 and 16/16; touched modules (`server`, `base-avatar`, `base-backup`,
  `base-delivery`, `base-fixes`, `base-profiles`, `base-registry`, `base-server`, `base-ui`, `remote-access`,
  `durable`) 157/157 (log `$TMPDIR/network-logs/task-02-touched.log`).
- Full `npm test` (log `$TMPDIR/network-logs/task-02-suite.log`, 2026-10-26 03:53–04:19): non-browser 1,522 tests,
  1,521 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled, 1 skipped (the same win32-only `editors.test.mjs` test as the baseline); browser
  146/146. Exit 0, no reruns. Baseline 1,506 + the 16 new tests = 1,522.
- Isolated smoke on port 4902 (temporary data and projects folders, PATH holding only a `node` symlink): `GET
  /api/network/agents` answered an empty page, no token 403, an unknown Base ID `BASE_PROFILE_INVALID`, a created
  network appeared as `network/networks/net__….json`; instance stopped and folder removed.

**Acceptance criteria and evidence:**

- *Register existing Base Agent without copying or changing Base definition:* registry test 1 (stored row keys are
  exactly the Network fields, no Base text in `agents.json`, `state.json` bytes and Base revision unchanged); HTTP
  test 2 (every non-Network file byte-identical).
- *Stable `agentId` survives restart; edit of Base is reflected as a reference, never cloned:* registry tests 2 and
  "a restart"; HTTP test 2 (new `startServer`, same responses).
- *Save draft vs published revisions; existing published versions remain unchanged:* registry "a draft saves and
  publishes" (v1 bytes and hash identical after edit and v2) and "a published version whose bytes no longer match".
- *Cyclic subnetwork composition is rejected; no save starts a worker:* registry cycle test; HTTP test 2 (self-cycle
  over HTTP, zero recorded processes across save, publish and import; no job code exists).
- *Legacy boards, Base records, backups and projects load unchanged:* HTTP test 2 (board created before Network,
  board export, Base and Origin answers and file hashes equal before, after and after a restart).

**Known limits.** `providerCapabilities` and Base "Used by" for registrations are not computed (Task 03 / open question
1). One queue serializes the whole registry, and the first read loads every draft sequentially (`ponytail:` notes).
Import body ceiling 32 MiB. A crash during an import's writes can leave disabled registrations or unreferenced
version files (nothing runs). No delete routes yet (Task 05 adds network delete; registrations are disabled instead).
Paid CLI runs: 0. The only app instance outside the tests was the port 4902 smoke above.

**Next task: 03.**
